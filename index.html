	<h1>Kygo</h1>
	<h3>Stargazing</h3>
	<p>You're saying it's hopeless, 
		That I should hope less
		Heaven can help us, 
		Well maybe "she" might
		You say it's beyond us, what is beyond us?
		Let's see and decide
		We've been meteoric, even before this
		Burns half as long 
		When it's twice as bright
		So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us
		Lets see and decide<br>
		And I will still be here, stargazing
		I'll still look up, look up
		Look up for love
		I will still be here, stargazing
		I'll still look up, look up
		Look up for love</p>
